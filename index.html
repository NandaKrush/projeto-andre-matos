                Fairy lady, who stands on the walls <br>
                Life is short and wait is long <br>
                The stars, away, dim with the dawn... <br>
                Fairy lady, who stands on the walls <br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Your tale has only begun <br>
                It comes from far, the Nowhereland <br>
                The wind is blowing a sound so well known... <br>
                Fairy lady, your love is long gone <br>

                Oh darling, hear my soul and heed my cry <br>
                Cause all my crying may flood a river in my heart <br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Oh, life is good, <br>
                Oh, life is good, <br>
                Oh, life is good... <br>
                As good as you wish!" <br>

                Pretty lady, the horses are back <br>
                Bringing joy and happiness <br>
                But all of a sudden the horses are gone <br>
                It was only the sound of your heartbeat alone! <br>

                Oh my darling, now I cannot halt my cries <br>
                My tears have drowned me <br>

                What's left around me, it's all so strange, it's all so dark <br>
                I'm all alone here <br>
                To mend the pieces of my heart <br>

                Little lady, your tale has an end <br>
                For your love to the skies was sent <br>
                He's turned into sparks that shine with the stars... <br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                ...And by night he will always be there <br>
                For his lady to stare <br>
                And thus he's never died. <br>
